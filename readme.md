# OrgManager

OrgManager takes Github Organization invites to a new level!

## Hosted version

Not everyone can afford a server, nor do they have the skills to set up a modern PHP application, so OrgManager provides a hosted version you can use **for FREE**. You can access the hosted version at [https://orgmanager.miguelpiedrafita.com](https://orgmanager.miguelpiedrafita.com). In exchange, please report any bugs you encounter, so we can continue inproving!

## Development version

These instructions will get you the beta version of the project up and running on your local machine for **development and testing** purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To install OrgManager you'll need:

- A web server of your choice - (We recommend [hotel](https://github.com/typicode/hotel), as it is easy to setup and doesn't require any configuration.)
- PHP - (At least v5.6.4, although v7.* is recommended. [Installing PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php))
- Some PHP libraries - (OpenSSL, PDO, Mbstring, Tokenizer, XML) (Google is your friend :smile:)
- Composer - ([Install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/))
- MySQL database - ([You can get them online for free](https://www.google.com/search?q=free+mysql+database))
- Git - ([Install GIT](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git))

### Installing

Now that you've verified that you have that, let's start...

1. Download beta version (Just clone the master branch)

If you have GIT, just open your terminal/console and run
```
git clone https://github.com/orgmanager/orgmanager
```
and you'll have the beta version on your new `orgmanager` folder.

2. Add OrgManager to your server.

Just google instructions for your server. If you're using [hotel](https://github.com/typicode/hotel), just open the OrgManager folder with the terminal/console and run

```sh
hotel add 'php artisan serve --port $PORT'
```

Now, if you configured the .dev domains, you can now access `orgmanager.dev`. If you didn't, access `localhost:2000` and click OrgManager. Yeah, it should be showing that huge error, don't worry :smile:

3. Setup .env

Copy the `.env.example` file to a `.env` file. Open the .env file with your favorite text editor/IDE and fill the database, reCaptcha and GitHub settings. (You can leave the rest as they are)

4. Finish the setup

Open the OrgManager folder with the terminal/console and run
```php
php artisan orgmanager:install
```

5. Done!

You have now the OrgManager beta version up an running in your server! (Note that OrgManager is not auto-updated, read the updating section for more info).

## About the tests

We don't have tests *yet*

> Why?

Well, this project was created when I started learning Laravel. I am still learning, and I currently don't master the tests part. Anyway, a PR is welcome to add tests. We expect to have tests for everything on OrgManager v4.

## Deployment

These instructions will get you the lastest stable version of the project up and running on your server for **production** purposes. See the development version section for notes on how to setup the beta version on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

To install OrgManager you'll need:

- Some PHP libraries - (OpenSSL, PDO, Mbstring, Tokenizer, XML) (Google is your friend :smile:)
- Composer - ([Install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/))
- MySQL database - (Although this isn't recommanded for a production enviroment, [you can get them online for free](https://www.google.com/search?q=free+mysql+database))
- SSH access to your server (physical access is also valid)
